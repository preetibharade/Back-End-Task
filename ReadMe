This API defines a route (POST /api/posts) for creating a new blog post. It expects the request body to contain title, content, and author fields. It then validates the request body, creates a new BlogPost document using Mongoose, and saves it to the MongoDB database.

User need to have MongoDB running locally on port 27017 for this example to work. Adjust the MongoDB connection string as necessary.

User can test this API using tools like Postman or by sending HTTP requests from his/her frontend application.
